    <p>In this Lasagna with Cottage Cheese, supple sheets of fresh lasagna noodles are layered with a meaty, deeply savory sauce and a rich cottage cheese and pecorino Romano filling then topped with a generous layer of creamy mozzarella cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Fresh Lasagna Noodles: </b>store-bought or homemade (If you want to make your own, I recommend these easy Homemade Lasagna Noodles made with 5-minute food processor pasta dough.)</li>
        <li><b>Olive Oil: </b>ideally extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li><b>Onions: </b>red onions for their mild sweetness and color</li>
        <li><b>Garlic: </b>fresh garlic cloves</li>
        <li><b>Pancetta: </b>  or bacon</li>
        <li><b>Tomatoes: </b>canned, crushed tomatoes with juice</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>It starts with fresh lasagna noodles. You can buy them at the grocery store or easily make homemade lasagna noodles with my food processor pasta dough recipe (make the dough with 4 ingredients in 5 minutes flat) and a crank pasta machine. You don't need to pre-boil these, and they absorb the sauce flavors beautifully.</li>
<li>Then you'll alternate layers of rich, meaty sauce, with pancetta ground beef and Italian sausage, silky, fresh lasagna noodles, and a creamy blend of cottage cheese, pecorino Romano and mozzarella cheese.</li>
<li>A final layer of melted mozzarella brings the dish home</li>
