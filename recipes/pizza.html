    <p>With a name like Florentina you would probably be willing to bet that I live La Bella Vita Under the Tuscan Sun and can toss a pizza like nobody’s business. The truth is I do live La Bella Vita but under the California sun and I can’t toss a pizza for the life of me.</p>
    <p>Although you can make this authentic Italian pizza dough recipe by hand, it is way easier to use a mixer. Fail proof, No tossing required! Honestly this is the real reason I got a Kitchen Aid mixer and a pizza stone, so we can make the best homemade pizza ever.</p>
    <p>After constantly trying new recipes and formulas, and after having gone to Italy in search of the perfect rustic authentic Italian pizza dough, I am even more confident that this is the best recipe out there. Beep-beep!</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Crust</b>is made from wheat, water and yeast, by kneading it for 5-10 minutes until its mass become perfectly mixed together. Toppings can be applied to the crust before or after baking, and there are even some versions of pizza that don't even use crust! Some of the traditional Italian pizzas are protected by European low, and cooks that want to sell them must abide with the strict rules regarding their creation.</li>
        <li><b>Sauce</b>is traditionally made from tomato, and can be additionally seasoned with wide variety of spices and herbs. There are many kinds of sauces that are used today, and one of their most important characteristics is their fluidity. Sauce that is too watered down can damage the consistency of the crust, and thicker sauces are better suited when you want to make the topping consistent across the entire pizza.</li>
        <li><b>Cheese </b>is traditionally the most common topping found on modern pizzas. Throughout the history many types of cheeses have been used in this meal, but most popular ones are Mozzarella, Ricotta, Feta, Parmesan, Cheddar and Monterey. Even though cheeses are rich with protein, calcium and sodium, they also can contain high amounts of fat. People who want to maintain their diet can choose to use low-fat cheeses, or to limit their amount and use more other toppings instead.

            Toppings that are placed over pizza are often arranged in specific order. This order is maintained not just for visual pleasure, but also to maintain the moisture and control the baking process of the crust. The most common bed for the various toppings is cheese, because it provides moisture and firmness to the material above it. For the same purposes, cheese can be applied on the top of the pizza. The most common order of applying toppings on the crust is following:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dough > Sauce > Cheese > Toppings > Cheese > Garnish</p>

    <p>Toppings can be divided into several types, and their use varies from type of pizza and region where is made. Those types are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Vegetables</b> (carrot, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, olives, beans, peppers, spinach, and more</li>
    <li><b>Nuts</b> (almonds, peanuts, pistachios, pine nuts, walnuts, and more)</li>
    <li><b>Herbs and Spices</b>(basil, coriander, garlic, oregano, pepper, rosemary, and more)</li>
    <li><b>Sea Food</b>(anchovies, lobster, shrimps, salmon, squid, tuna, oysters, and more)</li>
    <li><b>Meats </b>(bacon, ham, salami, meatballs, duck, chicken, barbequed meat, and more)</li>
    <li><b>Exotic toppings</b>(chocolate, marshmallows, cookies, edible gold, bananas, and more</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<p>just follow the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Sprinkle the yeast into a medium bowl with the warm water. We don’t mean hot, and we don’t mean cold… we mean warm! That’s the kind the yeast likes best. Stir until the yeast dissolves.</li>
<li>Place almost all of the flour on the table in the shape of a volcano. (Think Mt. Vesuvius… appropriate since Naples is the king of all pizza cities!).</li>
<li>Pour the yeast-and-warm-water mix, along with the other ingredients, into the “crater” of the volcano.</li>
<li>Knead everything together for 10 to 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic, keeping your surface floured.</li>
</ol>
